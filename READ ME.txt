Hello Person. 

This Needs Python! At Least version 3.10 and up.
It also requires a Python add-on named Tkinter to make the pop-up windows, so Install Tkinter in your CMD.

Steps To Install Tkinter:

Step 1: Press Win+R or just open CMD WITH admin permission.
Step 2: Type into the CMD the following:     pip install tk
Step 3: After it Installs Smooth Sailing, you can close the CMD and launch the .py file named “Choose Vehicle Main”

How To Use:

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND OPENING IT IN THE PYTHON IDLE, SINCE IT WILL BE EASIER TO CHANGE STUFF AND SEE ERRORS (it might not even work without it)
After You Open The “Choose Vehicle Main.py” file, you will see a window where you need to choose the directory of War Thunder. 
The Program will automatically do everything from there. 
Now Press Continue.
A window should open, and you can select the Nation And Vehicle you want to test drive. 

Have Fun!

P.S. You can check and use the code, but beware That It is A Mess because of my lacking python skills.

Also, I hope you like this little thing I made in 5 (or more) hours. 
If you find any bugs or anything else you want me to change or implement, message me at discordapp.com/users/916389301472882719
